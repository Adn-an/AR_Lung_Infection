# 3D Visualization and Interaction of Respiratory Infections by Exploiting 2D CNN-derived Attention Maps and A-Priori Information of Lung Dimension

**Code to "3D Visualization and Interaction of Respiratory Infections by Exploiting 2D CNN-derived Attention Maps and A-Priori Information of Lung Dimension" will be made publicly available here once the reviewing stage has been performed (Article under review).**

Nowadays, research activities in the fields of precision health and biomedical image analysis are developing rapidly. In this context, research work on the analysis of respiratory infections is still extensively investigated. 
Few open source systems with the goal of visualizing and manipulating lungs with infections in 3D space are currently proposed. 
Such systems could become an important tool in the training of new radiologists.
In the present work, we propose an approach that allows the user to visualize and interact with respiratory infections in 3D space by exploiting 2D CNN-derived attention maps.
